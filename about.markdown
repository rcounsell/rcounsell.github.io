Hi!

My name is Rhys Counsell. I am a final year PhD student at the University of Southampton. My supervisor is Nils Andersson.

My main research interest are in general relativity, hydrodynamics and gravitational waves. I am strongly interested in neutron star physics, such as their oscillation spectrum and their possible detection in gravitational wave signals.

You can find some of my work at (https://github.com/rcounsell).
